Collection of assignments and notions of "Calcolo Numerico" for the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at University of Parma (UniPR)

## **Description**
1. **INTRO-MATLAB (1 - 2)**

An introduction into the basis of matlab, with some guidelines for a better understanding of the language.

2. **GRAFICA**

Assignments about the graphical represantation of different functions and elements of MATLAB

3. **RADICI**

Application of iterative methods (Bisection algorithm, Newton method, Chord method)
to solve non-linear equations

4. **ALGEBRA LINEARE**

Application of iterative methods to solve linear sistems

5. **INTERPOLAZIONE - QUADRATI**

Approximation of data and functions using different methods
 - Interpolation of a functions using n+1 nodes and n+1 corrisponding 
    values to gain a polynomial *P(x)*
 - Using least square approximation to find the "closest" function to the data
   we are using.
